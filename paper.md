### Incremental Risk Charge Methodology

The incremental risk charge (IRC) is a new regulatory requirement from the Basel Committee in response to the recent financial crisis. Notably few 
models for IRC have been developed in the literature. This paper proposes a methodology consisting of two Monte Carlo simulations. The first Monte 
Carlo simulation simulates default, migration, and concentration in an integrated way. Combining with full re-valuation, the loss distribution at 
the first liquidity horizon for a subportfolio can be generated. The second Monte Carlo simulation is the random draws based on the constant level 
of risk assumption. It convolutes the copies of the single loss distribution to produce one year loss distribution. The aggregation of different 
subportfolios with different liquidity horizons is addressed. Moreover, the methodology for equity is also included, even though it is optional in IRC.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (see Basel [2009 a]) released the new guidelines for 
Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) that are part of the new rules developed in response to the financial 
crisis and is a key part of a series of regulatory enhancements being rolled out by regulators.

The constant level of risk assumption in IRC reflects the view that securities and derivatives held 
in the trading book are generally more liquid than those in the banking book and may be rebalanced 
more frequently than once a year (see Aimone [2018]).  IRC should assume a constant level of risk 
over a one-year capital horizon which may contain shorter liquidity horizons. This constant level 
of risk assumption implies that a bank would rebalance, or rollover, its positions over the one-year 
capital horizon in a manner that maintains the initial risk level, as indicated by the profile of 
exposure by credit rating and concentration.

### Bilateral Defaultable Financial Derivatives Pricing and Credit Valuation Adjustment

The one-side defaultable financial derivatives valuation problems have been studied extensively, but the valuation of bilateral derivatives with 
asymmetric credit qualities is still lacking convincing mechanism. This paper presents an analytical model for valuing derivatives subject to default 
by both counterparties. The default-free interest rates are modeled by the Market Models, while the default time is modeled by the reduced-form model 
as the first jump of a time-inhomogeneous Poisson process. All quantities modeled are market-observable. The closed-form solution gives us a better 
understanding of the impact of the credit asymmetry on swap value, credit value adjustment, swap rate and swap spread.

In this paper we present an analytical model for pricing defaultable IRS’s with asymmetric credit qualities. The model is based on the market models 
of interest rate dynamics and the reduced-form model of default time.

The object modeled under the market models is market-observable. It is also consistent with the market standard approach for pricing caps/floors using 
Black’s formula. The market models have now become some of the most popular models for pricing such derivatives. They are generally considered to have 
more desirable theoretical calibration properties than short rate or instantaneous forward rate models.
	
	
Unlike structural models, reduced-form models do not condition default explicitly on the value of the firm, and parameters related to the firm’s value 
need not be estimated to implement the model. For pricing and hedging, reduced-form models are the preferred methodology.
	
Our closed-form solution shows that the value of a bilateral defaultable IRS is the sum of the values of individual bilateral defaultable swaplets. 
Each bilateral defaultable swaplet can be replicated by buying a risk-adjusted call option and selling a risk-adjusted put option. The risk-adjusting 
factors depend on hazard rates, recovery rates and settlement rules.
	
In the case where the floating-rate payer is a LIBOR party, we confirm findings in Duffie and Huang (1996) that the swap spreads are relatively less 
sensitive to credit quality comparing to the bond spreads or the CDS spreads. The credit impact on swap rates is approximately linear. In the case 
where both parties have spreads against the LIBOR that was not studied closely before, we find that the credit impact on swap rates is not linear 
any more. The swap funding spreads have a significantly impact on swap spreads as well.
