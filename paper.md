## Financial Market Analysis

### A New Model for Pricing Collateralized OTC Derivatives
This paper presents a new model for pricing OTC derivatives subject to collateralization. It allows for collateral posting adhering to bankruptcy laws. 
As such, the model can back out the market price of a collateralized contract. This framework is very useful for valuing outstanding derivatives. Using 
a unique dataset, we find empirical evidence that credit risk alone is not overly important in determining credit-related spreads. Only accounting for 
both collateral arrangement and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account 
for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of derivatives. We also empirically gauge the impact of collateral agreements on risk 
measurements. Our findings indicate that there are important interactions between market and credit risk.

### An Accurate Solution for Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Wrong Way Risk
This paper presents a Least Square Monte Carlo approach for accurately calculating credit value adjustment (CVA). In contrast to previous studies, 
the model relies on the probability distribution of a default time/jump rather than the default time itself, as the default time is usually inaccessible. 
As such, the model can achieve a high order of accuracy with a relatively easy implementation. We find that the valuation of a defaultable derivative 
is normally determined via backward induction when their payoffs could be positive or negative. Moreover, the model can naturally capture wrong or right 
way risk.

### A Simple and Precise Method for Pricing Convertible Bond with Credit Risk
This paper presents a new model for valuing hybrid defaultable financial instruments, such as, convertible bonds. In contrast to previous studies, 
the model relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. 
As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly 
due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles 
have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the 
portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price.

### AN EFFICIENT LATTICE ALGORITHM FOR THE LIBOR MARKET MODEL
The LIBOR Market Model has become one of the most popular models for pricing interest rate products. It is commonly believed that Monte-Carlo 
simulation is the only viable method available for the LIBOR Market Model. In this article, however, we propose a lattice approach to price interest 
rate products within the LIBOR Market Model by introducing a shifted forward measure and several novel fast drift approximation methods. This model 
should achieve the best performance without losing much accuracy. Moreover, the calibration is almost automatic and it is simple and easy to implement. 
Adding this model to the valuation toolkit is actually quite useful; especially for risk management or in the case there is a need for a quick turnaround.

### Is the Jump-Diffusion Model a Good Solution for Credit Risk Modeling? The Case of Convertible Bonds
This paper argues that the reduced-form jump diffusion model may not be appropriate for credit risk modeling. To correctly value hybrid defaultable 
financial instruments, e.g., convertible bonds, we present a new framework that relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than 
the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. 
A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find 
evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible 
arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement 
in the underlying stock price.

### An Economic Examination of Collateralization in Different Financial Markets
This paper attempts to assess the economic significance and implications of collateralization in different financial markets, which is essentially a 
matter of theoretical justification and empirical verification. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that allows for collateralization 
adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out differences in asset prices due to collateralized counterparty risk. This framework is 
very useful for pricing outstanding defaultable financial contracts. By using a unique data set, we are able to achieve a clean decomposition of prices 
into their credit risk factors. We find empirical evidence that counterparty risk is not overly important in credit-related spreads. Only the joint 
effects of collateralization and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account 
for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of financial contracts. We also analyze the difference between cleared and OTC markets.

### The Impact of Default Dependency and Collateralization on Asset Pricing and Credit Risk Modeling
This article presents a comprehensive framework for valuing financial instruments subject to credit risk. In particular, we focus on the impact of 
default dependence on asset pricing, as correlated default risk is one of the most pervasive threats in financial markets. We analyze how swap rates 
are affected by bilateral counterparty credit risk, and how CDS spreads depend on the trilateral credit risk of the buyer, seller, and reference entity 
in a contract. Moreover, we study the effect of collateralization on valuation, since the majority of OTC derivatives are collateralized. The model 
shows that a fully collateralized swap is risk-free, whereas a fully collateralized CDS is not equivalent to a risk-free one.

### Incremental Risk Charge Methodology
The incremental risk charge (IRC) is a new regulatory requirement from the Basel Committee in response to the recent financial crisis. Notably few 
models for IRC have been developed in the literature. This paper proposes a methodology consisting of two Monte Carlo simulations. The first Monte 
Carlo simulation simulates default, migration, and concentration in an integrated way. Combining with full re-valuation, the loss distribution at 
the first liquidity horizon for a subportfolio can be generated. The second Monte Carlo simulation is the random draws based on the constant level 
of risk assumption. It convolutes the copies of the single loss distribution to produce one year loss distribution. The aggregation of different 
subportfolios with different liquidity horizons is addressed. Moreover, the methodology for equity is also included, even though it is optional in IRC.

### Pricing Financial Derivatives Subject to Multilateral Credit Risk and Collateralization
This article presents a new model for valuing financial contracts subject to credit risk and collateralization. Examples include the valuation of a 
credit default swap (CDS) contract that is affected by the trilateral credit risk of the buyer, seller and reference entity. We show that default 
dependency has a significant impact on asset pricing. In fact, correlated default risk is one of the most pervasive threats in financial markets. 
We also show that a fully collateralized CDS is not equivalent to a risk-free one. In other words, full collateralization cannot eliminate counterparty 
risk completely in the CDS market.

### Bilateral Defaultable Financial Derivatives Pricing and Credit Valuation Adjustment
The one-side defaultable financial derivatives valuation problems have been studied extensively, but the valuation of bilateral derivatives with 
asymmetric credit qualities is still lacking convincing mechanism. This paper presents an analytical model for valuing derivatives subject to default 
by both counterparties. The default-free interest rates are modeled by the Market Models, while the default time is modeled by the reduced-form model 
as the first jump of a time-inhomogeneous Poisson process. All quantities modeled are market-observable. The closed-form solution gives us a better 
understanding of the impact of the credit asymmetry on swap value, credit value adjustment, swap rate and swap spread.

### The Valuation of Financial Derivatives Subject to Counterparty Risk and Credit Value Adjustment
This article presents a generic model for pricing financial derivatives subject to counterparty credit risk. Both unilateral and bilateral types of 
credit risks are considered. Our study shows that credit risk should be modeled as American style options in most cases, which require a backward 
induction valuation. To correct a common mistake in the literature, we emphasize that the market value of a defaultable derivative is actually a risky 
value rather than a risk-free value. Credit value adjustment (CVA) is also elaborated. A practical framework is developed for pricing defaultable 
derivatives and calculating their CVAs at a portfolio level.
