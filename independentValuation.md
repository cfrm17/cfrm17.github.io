FinPricing provides independent derivative valuation service to customers to meet their specific audit and regulatory requirements on both financial securities and derivatives.

Our valuation service covers a broad spectrum of cross-asset instruments, including but not limited to some of the world’s most heavily traded products:
•	Securities: prefer shares, private equities, bonds, callable bonds, and exotic bonds.
•	Derivatives: fixed income, interest rate, equity, Forex, and money market.

Independent model validation is a vital part of model risk management. Independence means that a party who validates a model is not responsible for the model development or use, and does not have a stake in whether or not the model is determined to be approved for use.
