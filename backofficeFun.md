### Back Office Function

The back office is the supporting department of a company that carries out administrative functions that assist
the front office to facilitate the course of work and the business transactions. Back office functions include
settlements, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services.

Back office operations provide a range of corporate, non-core services, usually at a distance. Routine administrative tasks, customer service and 
technical support functions are examples of back office operations. (Back office operations are not the same as offshore operations, which establish 
business entities in tax-free export zones or offshore centres.

within this book are displayed in the main windows.
