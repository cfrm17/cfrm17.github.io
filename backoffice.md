### Back Office

A back office is the portion of a company made up of administration and support personnel who are behind-the-scenes and not client-facing, while front 
office staffs are the folks in contact with the consumers or clients. Back office functions include settlements, clearances, record maintenance, 
regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services.

A portfolio is a grouping of financial assets. It is more generically called book in FinPricing. A book could be a portfolio or trading strategy or desk. 
FinPricing portfolio management supports multi-level book(portfolio) hierarchies.

FinPricing provides interfaces for users to manage Counterparty, LegalEntity, and Exchange. Users need to create counterparties before booking derivatives. 
The management process of organization is very similar to the one of portfolio.

Back office operations provide a range of corporate, non-core services, usually at a distance. Routine administrative tasks, customer service and technical 
support functions are examples of back office operations. (Back office operations are not the same as offshore operations, which establish business 
entities in tax-free export zones or offshore centres.)

A back office is where work that supports front office work is done. Traditionally, front office staffs are the folks in contact with the consumers 
or clients, while the back office staffs are the people behind-the-scenes working in administrative or support roles. Back office functions include 
settlements, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IR services.
