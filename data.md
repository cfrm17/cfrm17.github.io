### Yield Curve Introduction

The term structure of interest rates, also known as yield curve, is defined as the relationship between the yield-to-maturity on a zero 
coupon bond and the bond’s maturity. Zero yield curves play an essential role in the valuation of all financial products. 
			
Yield curves can be derived from government bonds or LIBOR/swap instruments. The LIBOR/swap term structure offers several advantages over government 
curves, and is a robust tool for pricing and hedging financial products.  Correlations among governments and other fixed-income products have declined, 
making the swap term structure a more efficient hedging and pricing vehicle.

Zero rate curves, also called spot rate curves, are special and dominant type of yield curves. By definition, a zero rate curve is the 
term structure of the yields-to-maturity of zero coupon bonds. Given a zero rate,

### OIS Curve

Overnight index swaps (OIS) curves became the market standard for discounting collateralized cashflows. The reason often given for using 
the OIS rate as the discount rate is that it is derived from the fed funds rate and the fed funds rate is the interest rate usually paid 
on collateral. As such the fed funds rate and OIS rate are the relevant funding rates for collateralized transactions.
			
Many banks now consider that overnight indexed swap (OIS) rates should be used for discounting when collateralized portfolios are valued and that 
LIBOR should be used for discounting when portfolios are not collateralized.

The reason often given for using the OIS rate as the discount rate is that it is derived from the fed funds rate and the fed funds rate 
is the interest rate usually paid on collateral. As such the fed funds rate and OIS rate are the relevant funding rates for collateralized 
transactions.

### Cap Implied Volatility

An implied volatility is the volatility implied by the market price of an option based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. In cap market, 
a cap/floor is quoted by implied volatilities but not prices. An interest rate cap volatility surface is a three-dimensional plot of the implied 
volatility of a cap as a function of strike and maturity. 

In market, a cap/floor is quoted by implied volatilities rather than prices. An interest rate cap volatility surface is a three-dimensional 
plot of the implied volatility of a cap as a function of strike and maturity. 

ol skew or smile pattern is directly related to the conditional non-normality of the underlying returns. In particular, a smile reflects 
fat tails in the return distribution whereas a skew indicates asymmetry. A crucial property of the implied volatility surface is the 
absence of arbitrage.

### Inflation Linked Bond Curve

Inflation indexed bonds, also called inflation linked bonds or real return bonds, are bonds where the principal is indexed to inflation or deflation 
on a daily basis in terms of a reference index, such as Consumer Price Index (CPI). The primary purpose of these bonds is the transfer of inflation risk.

An inflation indexed bond is designed to hedge the inflation risk of the bond. Inflation bonds are an important vehicle for investors 
hose liabilities indexed to changes in inflation or wages. They have favorable performance and lower volatility relative to other risk 
assets. It is favorable to retirement planning and pension funds given its inflation protection. Inflation indexed bonds are less liquid 
than regular bonds.

Inflation linked bonds are mainly issued by government. There is also a small portion of inflation-linked bonds are issued by commercial 
financial institutions, that are usually treated as government-issued inflation-linked bonds.

### Cross Currency Basis Curve

Cross currency swap differs from single currency swaps in that the interest rate payments on the two legs are in different currencies. At inception 
of the trade, the notional principal amounts in the two currencies are usually set to be fair given the spot exchange rate. Contrary to single 
currency swap, there is an exchange of principals at inception and maturity, or even in each period of the swap.

Cross currency swaps are powerful instruments to transfer assets or liabilities from one currency to another. The market charges for 
this is a liquidity premium – the cross-currency basis spread. Thus, the market quoted cross-currency basis spreads usually relative 
to a liquidity benchmark. 

For a cross currency trade between one currency and another currency. If there is a higher demand for the currency, the party lending 
the dollar will ask for a premium. This premium is referred to as the cross currency basis. In general, the cross currency basis is 
a measure of the dollar shortage in the market. The more negative the basis is, the more severe the shortage.
