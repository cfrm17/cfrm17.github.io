### Credit Valuation Adjustment

Credit value adjustment (CVA) is the market price of counterparty credit risk that has become a central part of counterparty credit risk management.  
By definition, CVA is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true/risky portfolio value. CVA not only allows institutions to quantify 
counterparty risk as a single measurable P&L number, but also offers an opportunity for banks to dynamically manage, price, and hedge counterparty risk. 
The benefits of CVA are widely acknowledged. Many banks have set up internal credit risk trading desks to manage counterparty risk on derivatives.

CVA not only allows institutions to quantify counterparty risk as a single measurable P&L number, but also offers an opportunity for banks to dynamically 
manage, price, and hedge counterparty risk. The benefits of CVA are widely acknowledged. Many banks have set up internal credit risk trading desks 
to manage counterparty risk on derivatives. 

CVA, by definition, is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true (or risky or defaultable) portfolio value that takes into 
account the possibility of a counterparty’s default. The risk-free portfolio value is what brokers quote or what trading systems or models normally 
report. The risky portfolio value, however, is a relatively less explored and less transparent area, which is the main challenge and core theme for CVA. 
In other words, central to CVA is risky valuation.

In the market, risk-free values are quoted for most financial derivatives. In other words, credit risk is not captured. Historical experience shows 
that credit risk often leads to significant losses. Therefore, it is obvious to all market participants that credit risk should be taken into account 
when reporting the fair value of any defaultable derivative. The adjustment to the risk-free value is known as the credit value adjustment (CVA).

First, we want to indicate that the market value of a defaultable derivative is actually a risky value rather than a risk-free value. In fact, in applying 
the upfront CVA, we already converted the market value of a defaultable derivative from the risk-free value to the risky value.

For completeness, our theoretical study covers various cases. We find that the valuation of defaultable derivatives and their CVAs, in most situations, 
has a backward recursive nature and requires a backward induction valuation. An intuitive explanation is that two counterparties implicitly sell each 
other an option to default when entering into a defaultable transaction. If we assume that a default may occur at any time, the default options are 
American style options. If we assume that a default may only happen on the payment dates, the default options are either European options or Bermudan 
options. Both Bermudan and American options require backward induction valuations. 

Based on our theory, we propose a novel cash-flow-based practical framework for calculating the bilateral risky value and bilateral CVA at the counterparty 
portfolio level. This framework can easily incorporate various credit mitigation techniques, such as netting agreements and margin agreements, and can 
capture wrong/right way risk. Numerical results show that these credit mitigation techniques and wrong/right way risk have significant impacts on CVA.
