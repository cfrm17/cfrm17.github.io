The term structure of interest rates, also known as yield curve, is defined as the relationship between the yield-to-maturity on a zero coupon bond 
and the bond's maturity. Zero yield curves play an essential role in the valuation of all financial products. 

The current methodology in capital markets for marking to market securities and derivatives is to estimate and discount future cash flows using rates 
derived from the appropriate term structure. The yield term structure is increasingly used as the foundation for deriving relative term structures and 
as a benchmark for pricing and hedging. 

Click the Data tab at the top-left corner of the application. Then, expend Data -> InterestRateData -> InterestRateCurve and click the Construct button.

A selection window pops up. Fill currency symbol in Column 3 and curve date in Column 6 and also select Discounting Approach in Column 1 (e.g., OIS), 
Curve Type in Column 5 (e.g., Base) and associated Basis Type in Column 9 (e.g., NA for base curve). After that click the Go button

Yield curves can be derived from government bonds or LIBOR/swap instruments. The LIBOR/swap term structure offers several advantages over government 
curves, and is a robust tool for pricing and hedging financial products. Correlations among governments and other fixed-income products have declined, 
making the swap term structure a more efficient hedging and pricing vehicle.
