### Funding Valuation Adjustment

Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) is introduced to capture the incremental costs of funding uncollateralized derivatives. It can be referred to as the 
difference between the rate paid for the collateral to the bank’s treasury and rate paid by the clearinghouse. Also FVA can be thought of as a hedging 
cost or benefit arising from the mismatch between an uncollateralized client trade and a collateralized hedge in the interdealer market. FVA should be 
also calculated at portfolio level.

FVA is the cost of funding that is considered in the valuation of uncollateralized derivatives. It is introduced to quantify the adjustment to the 
value of derivatives in order to ensure that a trader recovers funding costs that are consistent with the market’s view of the funding costs associated 
with the same trade. This presentation elaborates an integrated framework for calculating both CVA and FVA. We also discuss the pros and cons of comparing 
the popular credit exposure approach and the more accurate least square Monte Carlo approach. 

CVA is very closely related to FVA. Credit value adjustment (CVA) is the market price of counterparty credit risk that has become a central part of 
counterparty credit risk management.  By definition, CVA is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true/risky portfolio value. 
CVA not only allows institutions to quantify counterparty risk as a single measurable P&L number, but also offers an opportunity for banks to dynamically 
manage, price, and hedge counterparty risk. The benefits of CVA are widely acknowledged. Many banks have set up internal credit risk trading desks to 
manage counterparty risk on derivatives.

Both FVA and CVA are computed on the basis of counterparty portfolio that need to take master agreement and collateral agreement into account. 
Master agreement is a document agreed between two parties, which applies to all transactions between them. Close out and netting agreement is part of 
the Master Agreement. If two trades can be netted, the credit exposure is E(t)=max(V_1 (t)+V_2 (t),0). If two trade cannot be netted (called non-netting), 
the credit exposure is E(t)=max(V_1 (t),0)+max(V_2 (t),0).

CSA (or Margin Agreement or Collateral Agreement) is a legal document that regulates collateral posting. Trades under a CSA should be also under a 
netting agreement, but not vice verse. It defines a variety of terms related to collateral posting: threshold, minimum transfer amount (MTA), independent 
amount (or initial margin or haircut), credit exposure after taking CSA into account.
