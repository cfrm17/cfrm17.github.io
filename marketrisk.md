## Market Risk


### Market Risk Flow

In the Risk Measurement Data Flow, positions are valued using models and market inputs. The valuation process is enhanced via Independent Price Valuation (IPV), Valuation Adjustments (VA) and proxy bookings. The valuation process then feeds profit and loss (P&L) and Risk which can be connected through the P&L Attribution (PAA). Market risk measures and diagnostics, such as VaR, are an outcome from the risk measures. This forms the cornerstones of the Market Risk Measurement Management and Data Review Process.

The Market Risk Measurement Management and Data Review Process establishes the linkages which are required in an effective risk management system. All data composing these linkages can theoretically trace dependencies back to market inputs and position inputs. Market inputs are defined as the inputs required in the valuation model that are dynamic in nature and are sourced from markets. As an input to the risk process, the positions require thorough review and validation processes to ensure completeness and consistency. The set of inputs required for valuation should also be employed for other calculations such as P&L attribution (PAA) and should be simulated when computing Value at Risk (VaR).
