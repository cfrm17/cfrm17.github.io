### Loss Trigger Leveraged Super Senior Tranche 

The valuation of LT-LSS trades has been a challenging task in both the industry and academia. LSS trades are essentially exotic options on the forward starting super senior tranche conditional on the trigger breach, which depends on the way how the correlated default events, credit spread of each reference obligor, and market implied correlations evolve over time. The exercise of a LSS trade is contingent on the trigger breach, which can happen at any time before the trade maturity. The value of the trade cannot be fully determined unless a dynamic process of the portfolio is modeled. Furthermore, compared with other triggers, the LT-LSS is the most complicated because it directly links the credit spread and the implied correlation movements to the default events of the collateral pool. It is almost impossible to get pertinent market information to calibrate such a conditional loss process, even if we can somehow model one. The base correlation curve is defined as the correlation inputs required for a series of equity tranches that gives the tranche value consistent with quoted spreads. It was introduced by JPMorgan to address the difficulty of applying market-implied correlation to a tranche with non-standard attachment and detachment points.
