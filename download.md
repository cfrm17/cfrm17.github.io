FinPricing is a capital market software system and solution that covers the entire transaction lifecycle for derivatives, securities and cash instruments, 
from trade capture, data service, performance monitoring and risk management, through to back office processing and reporting. This presentation provides 
user guides and instructions on how to download and install FinPricing.

Click the Download button on the menu bar from any page and then click the Download Now link.

The installer file “setup.exe” appears, most probably at the bottom left corner of your web browser.

Click to open the “setup.exe” and installation starts. Follow the on-screen instruction to finish.

If you are using Windows 10, sometimes nothing happens when you try to open the setup.exe file. Here is the solution: Right-click the setup file and 
then select "Shown in Folder".

The setup file in your download folder will appear. Right-click the setup file and then select "Properties". The property window pops up.

Check "Unblock" -> Apply -> OK. After that, double click the setup file. The installation starts.

After successful installation, you can find the application shortcut on your desktop.

Or find the application in ALL Programs by clicking Start -> All Programs -> FinPricing.

Click either of them to launch the application. Click the SIGNUP button to register first and then login with your email and password.
