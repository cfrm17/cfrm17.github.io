## Derivatives Valuation

### GIC Valuation

The payoff at maturity from a GIC can be shown equal to the invested principal plus these principal times the sum of the minimum guaranteed interest rate and the payoff from a European 
call option on the arithmetic average of a basket price at the 12 points above, where the basket price is given by a weighted sum of the index levels above.

### Quanto Himalayan Option 

Himalayan options are a form of European-style, path-dependent, exotic option on a basket of equity underliers, in which intermediate returns on selected equities enter the payoff, while the
equities are subsequently removed from the basket.

### Local Volatility Model for Callables 

We review a model for computing the price, in the domestic currency, of European standard call and put options on an underlying foreign equity (stock or index) with tenor of up to 7 years. 
The function implements a local volatility based pricing method.

### Forward Starting Option Valuation 

Forward start option is an option whose strike will be determined at some later date. Unlike a standard option, the strike price is not fully determined until an intermediate date before 
expiration. Cliquet option consists of a series of forward start options.

### Three Factor Convertible Bond Model

The owner of a convertible bond (CB) receives periodic coupon payments from the issuer, but can also convert the CB into the issuer’s stock.  The convertible bond may also include call 
and put provisions, which respectively allow the issuer to buy back the convertible bond and the owner to put the convertible bond for respective preset amounts.

### Mutual Fund Securitization Model

The purpose of the model is to determine, from a projected stream of future cashflows, whether all Commercial Paper used to fund the commissions to brokers for the sale of mutual funds 
will be repaid within a period.  Here a broker charges the Partnership a commission on the net asset value of the mutual funds sold.  The buyer of the mutual funds, however, pays nothing 
up front; instead, a deferred sales charge, which depends on when the mutual funds are redeemed, is assessed.

### Pricing Convertible Bond via Hull White Model

Using the Hull-White two-factor tree building procedure, a combined tree is constructed by matching the mean, variance and correlation corresponding to each combined tree node.  
The convertible bond price is given from the combined tree by backward induction.

### Brownian Bridge Approach

The Brownian bridge algorithm has been implemented for stress testing within the Risk Management framework. It is used for generation of multidimensional random paths whose initial and ending 
points are predetermined and fixed.

### Exchangeable Convertible Bond Model

A convertible bond issuer pays periodic coupons to the convertible bond holder. The bond holder can convert the bond into the underlying stock within the period(s) of time specified 
by the conversion schedule. The bond issuer can call the bond and the holder can put it according to the call and put provisions.

### Asset Backed Senior Note Valuation

We consider a securitization deal, which allows the holder to purchase co-ownership interests in a revolving pool of credit card receivables. To fund the acquisition of the interests in the revolving pool, 
the trust issued Asset-Backed Notes, in a number of different series. A share of future collections of credit charge receivables, to which the trust is entitled, is used to pay the interest and the 
principal of the notes.

### Hull White Volatility Calibration

Hull White model is a short rate model that is used to price interest rate derivatives, such as Bermudan swaption and accumulator exotics

### Bond Bootstrapping Approach

We discuss a method for bootstrapping a set of zero rates from an input set of US government money market securities and bonds. The government bond bootstrapping procedure requires to input a set of 
financial instruments, of the type below, sorted by order of increasing time to maturity:

### GIC Valuation

Guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is a financial instrument that offers a return based on a corresponding GIC rate and the performance of a basket of certain stock and bond market indices.

### Extendable Swap Valuation

We use analytical formulas for forward swap and swaption valuation: the swap price is calculated as the difference between a bond par and the bond’s price, and the swaption price is evaluated from the Black’s formula.
