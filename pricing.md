## Derivatives Valuation

### GIC Valuation

The payoff at maturity from a GIC can be shown equal to the invested principal plus these principal times the sum of the minimum guaranteed interest rate and the payoff from a European 
call option on the arithmetic average of a basket price at the 12 points above, where the basket price is given by a weighted sum of the index levels above.

### Three Factor Convertible Bond Model

The owner of a convertible bond (CB) receives periodic coupon payments from the issuer, but can also convert the CB into the issuer’s stock.  The convertible bond may also include call 
and put provisions, which respectively allow the issuer to buy back the convertible bond and the owner to put the convertible bond for respective preset amounts.

### Mutual Fund Securitization Model

The purpose of the model is to determine, from a projected stream of future cashflows, whether all Commercial Paper used to fund the commissions to brokers for the sale of mutual funds 
will be repaid within a period.  Here a broker charges the Partnership a commission on the net asset value of the mutual funds sold.  The buyer of the mutual funds, however, pays nothing 
up front; instead, a deferred sales charge, which depends on when the mutual funds are redeemed, is assessed.
