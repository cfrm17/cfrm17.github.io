## Derivatives Valuation

### GIC Valuation

The payoff at maturity from a GIC can be shown equal to the invested principal plus these principal times the sum of the minimum guaranteed interest rate and the payoff from a European 
call option on the arithmetic average of a basket price at the 12 points above, where the basket price is given by a weighted sum of the index levels above.

### Quanto Himalayan Option 

Himalayan options are a form of European-style, path-dependent, exotic option on a basket of equity underliers, in which intermediate returns on selected equities enter the payoff, while the
equities are subsequently removed from the basket.
