## Risk Management

### Counterparty Credit Risk
Counterparty credit risk measurement is credit exposure (CE). It is the cost of replacing or hedging a contract at the time of default. Other measures 
include Potential future exposure (PFE), Expected exposure (EE), Expected Positive Exposure (EPE), Effective expected exposure (EEE), Effective EPE, 
Exposure at default or EAD. This presentation is intended to answer several fundamental questions: what is CCR? How to measure CCR? What are the provisions 
governing counterparty risk?

### Counterparty Credit Risk Simulation Methodology
Counterparty credit risk (CCR) is the risk of loss that will be incurred in the event of default by a counterparty. It will be incurred in the event of 
default by a counterparty. Only over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and financial security transactions (e.g., repo) are subject to counterparty risk. 
If one party of a contract defaults, the non-defaulting party will find a similar contract with another counterparty in the market to replace the 
default one. That is why counterparty credit risk sometimes is referred as replacement risk. The replacement risk is the MTM value of a counterparty 
portfolio at the time of the counterparty default.

### Collateral Management
Collateral is a property or an asset that a borrower offers as a way for a lender to secure the loan. Collateral arrangement is a risk reduction tool 
that mitigates risk by reducing credit exposure. Collateral doesn’t turn a bad counterparty into a good one and doesn’t eliminate credit risk. Instead, 
it just reduces the loss at the time of default. Collateral arrangement is an essential element in the plumbing of the financial system.

### Credit Valuation Adjustment
Credit value adjustment (CVA) is the market price of counterparty credit risk that has become a central part of counterparty credit risk management.  
By definition, CVA is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true/risky portfolio value. CVA not only allows institutions to quantify 
counterparty risk as a single measurable P&L number, but also offers an opportunity for banks to dynamically manage, price, and hedge counterparty risk. 
The benefits of CVA are widely acknowledged. Many banks have set up internal credit risk trading desks to manage counterparty risk on derivatives.

### Funding Valuation Adjustment
Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) is introduced to capture the incremental costs of funding uncollateralized derivatives. It can be referred to as the 
difference between the rate paid for the collateral to the bank’s treasury and rate paid by the clearinghouse. Also FVA can be thought of as a hedging 
cost or benefit arising from the mismatch between an uncollateralized client trade and a collateralized hedge in the interdealer market. FVA should be 
also calculated at portfolio level.

### FRTB Standarlized Approach
The Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) is a new Basel committee framework for the next generation market risk regulatory capital rules. It is 
inspired by the undercapitalisation of trading book exposures witnessed during the financial crisis. FRTB aims to address shortcoming of the current Basel 
2.5 market risk capital framework.
