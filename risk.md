## Risk

### Counterparty Credit Risk
Counterparty credit risk measurement is credit exposure (CE). It is the cost of replacing or hedging a contract at the time of default. Other measures 
include Potential future exposure (PFE), Expected exposure (EE), Expected Positive Exposure (EPE), Effective expected exposure (EEE), Effective EPE, 
Exposure at default or EAD. This presentation is intended to answer several fundamental questions: what is CCR? How to measure CCR? What are the provisions 
governing counterparty risk?

### Counterparty Credit Risk Simulation Methodology
Counterparty credit risk (CCR) is the risk of loss that will be incurred in the event of default by a counterparty. It will be incurred in the event of 
default by a counterparty. Only over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and financial security transactions (e.g., repo) are subject to counterparty risk. 
If one party of a contract defaults, the non-defaulting party will find a similar contract with another counterparty in the market to replace the 
default one. That is why counterparty credit risk sometimes is referred as replacement risk. The replacement risk is the MTM value of a counterparty 
portfolio at the time of the counterparty default.
