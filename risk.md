## Risk Management


One of the central tenets of financial economics is the necessity of some trade off between risk and expected return. Because high risk is associated 
with high reward, investor may potentially obtain higher profits only if he is willing to accept a higher chance of losses. Risk-return trade-off is 
one trading principal in financial markets.

Risk management is a process to identify and measure risk. The goal of risk management solution is to ensure that risk is under limit and there is no 
surprise in future. In capital markets, risk management is accountable for oversighting and monitoring the profit and loss, market risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk and valuation risk activities of a firm.
