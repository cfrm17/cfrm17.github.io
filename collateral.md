### Collateral Management

Collateral is a property or an asset that a borrower offers as a way for a lender to secure the loan. Collateral arrangement is a risk reduction tool 
that mitigates risk by reducing credit exposure. Collateral doesn’t turn a bad counterparty into a good one and doesn’t eliminate credit risk. Instead, 
it just reduces the loss at the time of default. Collateral arrangement is an essential element in the plumbing of the financial system.

In the derivatives world, collateral posting is a risk reduction tool that mitigates risk by reducing credit exposure. It allows financial institutions 
to reduce economic capital and credit risk, free up lines of credit, and expand the range of counterparties. All of these factors contribute to the 
growth of financial markets. The benefits are broadly acknowledged and affect dealers and end users, as well as the financial system generally.  

The Bankruptcy code affords special treatment to financial derivative contracts that allows counterparties to terminate derivative contracts with a 
debtor in bankruptcy and seize the underlying collaterals. This presentation gives an overview of collateral arrangement in the derivatives market. 
It also illustrates how collateral management impact valuation and counterparty credit risk.  

The Bankruptcy code generally prevents creditors from seizing assets of a firm in bankruptcy. This provision is called the “automatic stay”. The code 
affords special treatment to financial derivative contracts, which exempts these contracts from the “automatic stay”. The special treatment is also 
called a safe harbor. The safe harbor allows counterparties to terminate derivative contracts with a debtor in bankruptcy and seize the underlying 
collaterals.

The benefits of Collateral Posting inlude: reduce credit risk, free credit lines with existing counterparties, increase business with counterparties,
expand the range of counterparties, and equalize the disparity in counterparty creditworthiness.

There are two types of collateral arrangement: pledge and title transfer. Under the Pledge type, the giver posts collateral to the taker and the giver still 
owns the collateral. If the giver defaults, the taker can take the cash or sell the securities. It is widely used in US.

Under the Title Transfer type, the taker owns the collateral and the giver is only entitled to the return of fungible securities and/or repayment of cash.
It is widely used in the stock-lending and repo market.

CSA (or Margin Agreement or Collateral Agreement) is a legal document that regulates collateral posting. Trades under a CSA should be also under a netting 
agreement, but not vice verse. It defines a variety of terms related to collateral posting. Threshold (TH) defines the amount below which no collateral 
is posted. Minimum transfer amount (MTA) is the minimum amount that can be transferred for any margin call. Independent amount (or initial margin or 
haircut): it is the amount of collateral required to open a position.
